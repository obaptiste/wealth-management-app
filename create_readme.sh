   - Includes potential integration with social media sentiment (Twitter).

4. **Admin Dashboard**  
   - Built with **Next.js** for displaying and managing users, invoices, and more.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/obaptiste/wealth-management-app.git
   cd wealth-management-app

	2.	Check Requirements
	•	Python 3.9+ (for the backend)
	•	Node.js 16+ (for the admin dashboard)
	•	Docker/Docker Compose (optional but recommended for a consistent setup)
	3.	Set Up Environment Variables
	•	At minimum, set a .env or environment variables for your database URL (if not using SQLite) and any secret keys.
	•	For local development, you can rely on default config or placeholder environment variables.

Setup and Installation

1. Backend Setup (FastAPI)
	1.	Create a virtual environment and activate it:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows


	2.	Install Python dependencies:

cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	Run database migrations (if you’re using Alembic):

alembic upgrade head



2. Frontend Setup (Next.js Admin Dashboard)
	1.	Navigate to your admin dashboard folder (e.g., admin_dashboard):

cd ../admin_dashboard


	2.	Install dependencies:

npm install


	3.	Start the local dev server:

npm run dev


	4.	Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the dashboard.

Running Locally

Start the FastAPI server
	1.	Go to the backend folder (if not already there):

cd ../backend


	2.	Run the server with Uvicorn:

uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000


	3.	Access the API docs at http://localhost:8000/docs.

Start the Admin Dashboard
	1.	In a separate terminal, navigate to the dashboard folder:

cd admin_dashboard
npm run dev


	2.	Go to http://localhost:3000 to manage customers, invoices, and more.

Using Docker

If you prefer a Docker-first approach, you can containerize everything:
	1.	Ensure Docker is installed and running.
	2.	In the root directory, create or adjust a docker-compose.yml (or build separate Dockerfiles for the backend and frontend).
	3.	Build and run containers:

docker-compose up --build


	4.	By default, the backend will be on port 8000, and the frontend on port 3000 (depending on your Compose config).

	Note: If your Next.js app needs to talk to the backend in a Docker network, ensure API calls point to http://backend:8000 or the correct alias/port.
